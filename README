# Algorithms and Data Structures (ID1021)

This repository contains my coursework for **ID1021 - Algorithms and Data Structures**, a course I completed at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

 📚 About the course
The course covers fundamental algorithms and data structures, with an emphasis on both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. Topics include:

- Basic data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- Algorithm design and analysis (time & space complexity, Big O)
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
- Recursive algorithms and problem solving
- Complexity theory basics

 📂 Contents
This repository contains:

- 📄 **PDF reports** — documenting problem-solving approaches, algorithm analysis, and implementation details.
- ✍️ Written explanations of algorithmic concepts and examples.
- (Optional: if you have code) 💻 Code samples demonstrating the algorithms and data structures studied.

 🛠 Tools & languages
Primarily written work and algorithm pseudocode. Some examples (if included) are implemented in:

- Python
- Java
- or other languages as applicable.

 🚀 Purpose
This repository serves as:

- A portfolio of my understanding and work in algorithms & data structures.
- A reference for future studies or projects involving algorithmic problem solving.
